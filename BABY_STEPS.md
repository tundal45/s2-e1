# Project: Rapportive style MailBot #

## This bot will receive a person's email address and respond with links to their multiple web presence. #

I recently had to complete a code challenge where I learned **the hard way** that
I am very bad at coding when I do not plan & focus on bite sized tasks. Therefore,
I am going to keep track of each individual task that I need to accomplish
to complete this project. I'm hoping that these tasks would help me keep track
of my progress as well as form the base for my tests.

At any given time prior to completion of the project, the list of tasks are not
going to be exhaustive. I am going to try a new way of listing the next 3 items that
I need to do for this project and only add more tasks to this list after I complete the
three listed before.

### Tasks ###

1.  <strike>Create a free gmail account for the bot</strike>
2.  <strike>Learn how to setup a proper directory structure for a Ruby Project & do that.</strike>
3.  <strike>Write the first piece of code that uses [mikel's mail gem](http://github.com/mikel/mail) to send a test email from the script.</strike>
4.  <strike>Write code that checks the inbox for new email</strike>
5.  Write a method to parse the email body for required information (in my case, all I am looking for is email and maybe name of the social networks to search in as optional arguments)
6.  Write a method that parses the result of the API call (initially assume the API exists to get the other moving parts working)
7.  Writ a method that composes an email using the parsed data.
8.  Design the API to use Template Method pattern where there is a generic search and specific search of user within each Social Network using their individual API
9.  Call the generic API with this information
